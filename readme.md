# Parkade - Automated Parking System
## Introduction
Parkade is an automated parking system developed as a course project for Data Mining. The aim of this project is to create a program that can identify when a car enters and leaves a parking lot and calculate the fare accordingly. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect cars and process their entry and exit times.

## Requirements
To run the Parkade program, you need a platform that supports Python programming. The following modules are required:
- os Module
- cv2 Module (OpenCV)
- numpy Module
- math Module
- random Module
- datetime Module
- time Module
Make sure you have these modules installed on your Python environment before running the program.

## Conclusion
Parkade is an automated parking system that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect cars entering and exiting a parking lot. By accurately identifying car events and calculating the fare, Parkade simplifies the parking process and provides a convenient solution for parking lot management.
